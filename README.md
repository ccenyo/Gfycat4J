# Gfycat4J

Gfycat is one of the most popular user-generated Gif website.

Gfycat for java is an open source java library for [https://gfycat.com](https://gfycat.com), it's basically a wrapper for the API.
you can find all information about the api [here](https://developers.gfycat.com/api/#introduction).
This api is still in developpement for now. If you want to help me finish it and maintain it, fill free to make a pull request. i will be more than happy to add you feature

If you find yourself on this page, it means that you have a java project and you need to communicate with your Nas Synology.
This wrapper can be a great startup for that.
